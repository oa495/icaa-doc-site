# Old Media

## Interactive Installations / Real Time Art
- Requires something of the body, cinema requires a fixed gaze, interactive installations some kind of body movement
- Relies on light
- Audience/viewer is allowed agency. Agency becomes an operative aspect of the work, explicitly in the form of interface and response - a noticeable change or effect on the work from your engagement with it


## Digital 2D Art (programs like Adobe, Procreate, etc)
- Technical elements (composition, value, color, shape, line, light)
- Lost to app or storage issues, can be stolen/scraped when posted online. of tools: many are subscription-based, not actually owned by user
- Digital tools can make production faster and provide shortcuts for things like erasing. - Easier to share. Access to all tools in one place instead of having to buy expensive art supplies, more portable. 


## Videogames
 - Storytelling, cinematography
 - Choice making, learning by doing, emergent storytelling, (sometimes) 3D sense of space / existence of “something around the corner” to explore, locus of agency


## AI/Generated Images
- Can be manipulated, staged, rehearsed


## Image/Video in Feed
- Can use color, sizes, shapes. Two dimensional. Has (only?) surface.
- Rectangular frame
- Can't control context (can see an art piece next to a picture of scrambled eggs)
- Curation based on algorithm
- Requires some access to system/ institution (gallery, or internet/technology)
- Abundance of images
- Images from far away places, access
- Surveillance

## Garageband, virtual instruments, exchanges of samples, mp3s
- Sound manipulation, private/intimate shared practice setting, capacity to record + loop
- fine-tuning volume & comfort, visual representation of layering, retroactive sound-editing


## 3D animation
- Storytelling, character performance, emotional expression. Core principles of animation.
- Reusable rigs and assets. Characters don’t need to be drawn every frame. environment models projected into 2D camera
- Hardware demands and cost. Heavy technical knowledge now required. 

## Digital games
- Player agency, rules, play
- Interactivity outside physical space, adaptivity outside of individual players, no thinking together, digital sociality

## 3D Sculpture
- form-making, proportions, composition
- shape creation
- material shaping
- “Infinite” reproducibility, infinite undo/redo, smoothness, ease of sharing
- Only move fingers (instead of whole body to see)

## Interactive Story / Twine
- Text, images, emotion, characters, speculation
- Relationship to time, space, reality - narrative moves the reader through space and time, and into another reality
- Choice/agency
- Easier to share, multiple people can access at the same time, are still plugged into www
- Capacity for other aesthetic elements outside of text (images (moving or otherwise), music, etc)
- New means of non-linearity
- Constrained by the web, limited by wifi connections, access to technical infrastructure

## Digital archive
- Memory
- Recording, classifying, and delineating spaces for information
- Limited by physical constraints(space for objects vs. data centers)
- Ongoing investments needed for materials (physical representation vs. data refinement tools)
- The consequences of choice become visible (One must cross out/qualify/start over vs. reorganize)
- Perfected presentation (given the ability to infinitely delete and edit), curation made easier
- Sooo many copies


## Streaming music albums
- Can listen to music of your choice
- ease of access, can listen anywhere

## Personalized ads
- annoyance
- high interaction, interrupts attention/activity, knows what you want before you do, predictive


## ​Data / Web-Scraping
- Reuse of found “objects”, Recontextualization
- No physical engagement with work, mediated by screen
- Legal concerns, access to information deliberately made private


## Web Zine
- Interactivity
- No constraints to physical materials like paper or ink, constrained by infrastructures of the web server farms or wi-fi connection
- Infinite access
