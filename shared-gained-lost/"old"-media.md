# Old Media

## Cinema
- Requires something of the body, cinema requires a fixed gaze, interactive installations some kind of body movement
- Relies on light
- Finality of authorship
- Control over pace

## Analog/Traditional 2D Art (pencil, ink, marker, etc)
- Technical elements (composition, value, color, shape, line, light)
- Tactility and  privacy/ownership

## Cinema
 - Storytelling, cinematography
 - Assurance of intentionality with each frame

## Camera photography
- Can be manipulated, staged, rehearsed
- Handheld device, some interaction with the world

## Painting (in Gallery)
- Can use color, sizes, shapes. Two dimensional. Has (only?) surface.
- Rectangular frame
- Shared Context in relation to multiple authors/artists
- Curation
- Requires some access to system/ institution (gallery, or internet/technology)
- Aura
- The third dimension of images (texture)
- Tactility

## Music– practicing in a space with people (a band) using physical instruments
- Sound manipulation, private/intimate shared practice setting, capacity to record + loop
- Vibrations in air & ground, micro-reactions to folks’ body movements, sense of improvisation, variations in timbre

## Hand-drawn animation
- Storytelling, character performance, emotional expression. Core principles of animation.
- Organic charms, stylistic variety of lines drawn by hand. Animators used to have connection with every frame.

## Physical games
- Player agency, rules, play
- Tangibility (game pieces, other bodies), physical sociality

## Traditional sculpture
- form-making, proportions, composition
- shape creation
- material shaping
- materiality, uniqueness, “faults”, can touch and feel

## Fictional story/book
- Text, images, emotion, characters, speculation
- Relationship to time, space, reality - narrative moves the reader through space and time, and into another reality
- Capacity for immersion
- Mobility and visibility (someone can see what you are reading in public)
- Tactility
- Personalization (where you dog ear the book, where you might write in the margins)
- Constrained by availability & geographic access, book bans/destruction

## Physical archive
- Memory
- Recording, classifying, and delineating spaces for information
- Limited by physical constraints(space for objects vs. data centers)
- Ongoing investments needed for materials (physical representation vs. data refinement tools)
- The consequences of choice become visible (One must cross out/qualify/start over vs. reorganize)
- Feeling of permanence


## Music Albums
- Can listen to music of your choice
- Deliberate, inescapable curation (in a particular order)
- Having the physicality of the album cover and booklet.

## Pop-up ads
- annoyance
