           The information on this site is from an in class exercise where partipants were first asked to list features of different forms of computational mediums: their features, visual forms, characteristics and qualities. Then they were asked to categorize these features into ones that were changeable by the creator/artist and ones that were unchangeable, or built-in to the medium.
